## the code

All source is found under the *fuentes* directory

The translator code was generated using [javacc 5.0](https://javacc.org/) with the definition
in the file traductor.jj (see generarTraductor.sh script).

The generated code is located in *fuentes/traductor/* directory.


## usage

The two programs (main methods) are located in the *programas* directory

to compile and run both the compiler and interpreter, follow the commands
in the file *tests.sh*
